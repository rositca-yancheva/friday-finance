# Full-Stack Developer Challenge

At **[Friday Finance](https://fridayfinance.com/)** we use many tools, technologies and integrations to third-party service providers, but our core application stack is currently based on [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react), [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.com/), [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

When it comes to full-stack developers and tech stack, we have two strong beliefs here:
1. Everyone can (and should) be full-stack, writing all the layers of the solution. We are a customer-centered company, and all users want is access to great, fully-functional features. They don't care about shiny pieces of code in a layer of abstraction they will never see. Yes, good code is a must, but only code that delivers the desired features matters.
2. Developers can't be "married" to their beloved technologies (or to whatever is at the height of fashion right now). Being able to write good vanilla JavaScript is more important than being a big TypeScript evangelist. Writing excellent SQL is more important than knowing all about the latest ORM. We display our current stack, but we target developers that won't complain if (for a hypothetical reason) we decide to change from, say, Vue to native Web Components, or from Node to Deno, or maybe remove Prisma and create our own in-house ORM...

Therefore, this technical challenge for the full-stack developer role is focused on **being able to quickly adapt to our stack** (even if you aren't used to something in it), **being able to offer an end-to-end solution to the problem** (from the interface to the database), and **being able to show good decisions based on attention to details** (after all, software development is a science, but also an art of crafting the best experience possible in each feature you put your hands on).

## TL;DR

The challenge is to create a small SPA composed of two routes, one to show the list of financial transactions, and another one to show a specific transaction details. The two general requirements are just:
- The main page should show a table of transactions, allowing to textually search transactions and/or to filter by bank, by account or by date range (start month and end month).
- The details page should be shown after clicking on a row of the previous table, then allowing to update the category of the shown transaction, by selecting an existing category or even creating a new category.

There's no mandatory layout to copy, but we propose to show something simple yet organized in a minimalist way. Take the image as a bare example of the main page layout, not as a strict design to follow. And the details page is totally open to your own creativity, surprise us.

Use the technologies of our stack as much as you can (preferably, use all), but TypeScript is expected only for the backend. Some [CSV files](./data/) with a bunch of sample data are attached to this repository.

## Technical Details

If you were not lazy enough for stop right on the [TL;DR](#tldr), nice! Here is a step-by-step explanation to you.

### General Instructions

As any good full-stack Web solution, you'll need frontend (aka client-side code), backend (aka server-side code), and database layers in place. On top of that, the solution itself is really simple, since this challenge is more like a partial [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) than anything really exotic.

> _**Tip:** We don't really care if you create the project as a monorepo, or as separated repositories for frontend and backend, or as a bunch of microservices and micro frontends, or whatever. But we do care if you choose some approach, without leveraging advantages of that choice, or without understanding the disadvantages. Be prepared to explain your decision._

Besides any project/repository structure you may choose, we want to be able to quickly and easily use it. Remember to have good documentation in place on how to setup up and run things.

> _**Tip:** If we can just hit one or two `package.json` scripts and everything is up to test your solution, we consider it a bonus._

And, on top of all that, we do appreciate organization and consistence a lot. No matter how much repositories or files your solution do have, organize them all properly, follow strong code standards and consistent naming patterns, even your commits will be considered.

> _**Tip:** If in doubt, we like [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) here._

### Set up the Database

To create the database, the best scenario is if you can follow the schema-first strategy with Prisma, first creating a schema file that describes each entity (with proper normalization in mind), then generating SQL migrations to build the relational DB.

> _**Tip:** If your code can show us a strong understanding on Prisma schema, database level types, primary keys, foreign keys, indexes, we consider it a bonus. Also, if you can automate the local database creation/configuration step, i.e. exposing a PostgreSQL instance as a Docker container with migrations and seed automatically applied, within only one command to run, we consider it a bonus._

To populate the database, the best scenario is if you can leverage Prisma's seed feature to automatically fill the tables with the sample data we provide as CSV files for [transactions](./data/transactions.csv), [accounts](./data/accounts.csv), and [categories](./data/categories.csv).

> _**Tip:** If your code can show us a good ability to handle CSV files and to batch insert thousands of records in short time, we consider it a bonus._

### Building the API

To build the API, the best scenario is if you can base yourself on Apollo Server, using a schema-first strategy with GraphQL tags, with every resolver properly TypeScript-typed, and using Prisma features to communicate with the database.

> _**Tip:** If your code can show us interesting ways of solving the problem, like good structure and modularization with growth of the API in mind, or using auto-generated types directly from the GraphQL tags, or solid TypeScript knowledge, or exploring cool Prisma features, or having Jest unit tests coverage in place, or any other cool thing, or all that together, we consider it a bonus._

When it comes to the software architectural decisions in general, you're free to structure your API following your own decisions about organization, modules, abstraction, reusability.

> _**Tip:** Just keep in mind that we appreciate [DRY](http://wiki.c2.com/?DontRepeatYourself) principles, but we also understand that [KISS](https://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html) and even [AHA](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming) are super important for fast-paced environments like ours is, so be prepared to explain your rationale._

### Building the App

To create the SPA, the best scenario is if you use Vue and Nuxt, however you're free to choose between Vue/Nuxt 2, or Vue/Nuxt 3. If you choose the Vue 2 path, we'll value way more if you do that with Vue 2.7 and **Composition API** instead of Options API. If won't choose to go with Nuxt (and remember that you may be asked on why), remember to handle properly the routes using Vue Router.

> _**Tip:** As already mentioned, TypeScript in the frontend is not required, but if you decide to use, enable all strict enforcements because we don't like to see `any` anywhere. Besides that, if your code can show us interesting ways of solving the problem, like good structure with growth of the interface in mind, or a care on internationalization aspects, or exploring cool Vue/Nuxt features, or having Jest unit tests coverage in place, or having Cypress end-to-end tests in place, or having Storybook documenting your components, or any other cool thing, or all that together, we consider it a bonus._

To visually enhance the pages, the best scenario is if you can do with Tailwind 3, but if you want to show incredible raw CSS abilities, feel free to go this way. Remember to be prepared to explain any decisions you've made.

> _**Tip:** Besides the way you'll decide to style the pages, we really appreciate developers with good sense of usability, accessibility, and UX in general. If your code can show us abilities on these topics, we consider it a bonus._

To communicate with the API, the best scenario is if you can leverage Apollo Client to deal with it. But how to integrate it in the code, what package to use, how to organize the GraphQL queries, all that is open to your choice.

> _**Tip:** We don't really care if you use the raw `apollo-client` library, or if you go with `vue-apollo` or `nuxt-apollo` wrappers. But again, be prepared to explain the reason._

Finally, we are here to see your own abilities on writing code, not on getting others code. We usually don't like to see third-party Vue components in use, it's extremely recommended to write your own components, or just use native browser elements if you can't.

> _**Tip:** The number of Vue components you will write matters, for the good and the bad. If your code can show us precise decisions on what and when to "componentize", splitting pages in good self contained and reusable pieces, we consider it a bonus._

## FAQ

### Where and how do I need to publish the solution?

If you can provide a link to a public GitHub repository with a well written `README.md`, all good. No need to deploy it anywhere (unless you really want to do that to show something special). During the meeting we'll arrange with you after the challenge, you will show us the solution by sharing your screen, so the deploy really doesn't matter.

Please, just send your challenge results to [jobs@fridayfinance.com](mailto:jobs@fridayfinance.com) in case you arrived here by yourself, or to your person of touch at Friday Finance.

### Do I need to use all that transactions in the CSV file?!

Yes, we crafted with love a batch with `349933` sample transactions. This way, you can show us that you know how to work with large sets of data without compromising performance. **It's a super important part of the challenge.** 😉

### But can I return all that transactions to the page directly?!

Please read the previous answer.

### Should I use something like infinite scrolling or pagination in the transactions page?

Please read the previous answer.

### Am I supposed to build filtering capabilities plus textual search in the transactions page?

Yes, as described and shown in the sample layout.

### Should the transactions table support sorting?

While not explicitly asked for, the sample layout hints about it. We are curious to see what you would decide in a case like this one. 😊

### What about the transaction details page?

Just decide the best way you think all the data of that transaction should be shown. Of course an end user wouldn't want to see ids, so use the proper entity relations to show only names of foreign entities. And about the category insert/update requirement, a custom autocomplete component with the requested behavior would be incredible, don't you think? 💡

### What is the desired behavior of a certain functionality?

Anything not explicitly described is open to your decision. But remember that **attention to detail** is a core value being evaluated here. Most of the requirements are documented here.

### What is more important, the code structure or the way the solution works?

Both. 😉

### I'm not familiar with a certain part of the required stack, is it mandatory to use it?

We love to see people trying to fit to our stack, even without previous experience in it. For example, we already saw React developers with no previous Vue experience showing excellent results which they never thought to be possible before, or self nominated frontend developers creating very organized GraphQL APIs in short time as they never expected.

Remember that **being able to quickly adapt to our stack** is a core value being evaluated here. That being said, you're free to show the best you can, the way you believe you should.

### I won't be able to finish the challenge in time, what should I do?

Let us know why you can't. If it's an acceptable reason, we'll give you a few more days. But not being able to finish the challenge in time is not a reason to skip the challenge, just talk openly with us and any unexpected situation can easily be solved.

### I'm a super senior developer, why a coding challenge?

In our experience, it's more difficult to find developers who are experienced in all pieces of technology a company uses than finding oil in your backyard. Therefore, it's really important to us to see the challenge solved before being able to continue the hiring process.

Also, here we like to level developers based on their fit to Friday Finance's needs, not based on other arbitrary metrics like years since graduation or years using some technology of our stack. Hence, if you want to be considered for a senior role, why not prove it? 😎

> **Tip:** We don't want to insult anyone. If you are sure that you are at a unique level of excellence, and you have some strong examples of this excellence, like in public repositories, just send us some links and we will see if we can skip the challenge.

### What is the next step in the hiring process?

After you send us the confirmation of completion with link(s) to the repository(ies), we'll arrange a meeting with you shortly afterwards, where you will show us the solution and code by sharing your screen. Anything after that will depend on the results shown. Good luck! 🙂

### I have more questions about this challenge, where do I ask?

You should have all information you need laid out here. Be attentive to all details and make decisions where you can't find instructions. After all, your capacity to make and justify decisions is an important part of what is being evaluated!
